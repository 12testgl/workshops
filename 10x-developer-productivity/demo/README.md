# 10x developer productivity demo

This folder contains all the resources for the 10x developer productivity demos.

This demo is based around a bare bones Flutter app, and in the session you use Pieces to add more to this.

This demo folder contains the following:

- [`my_amazing_flutter_app`](./my_amazing_flutter_app) - The bare bones Flutter app that you will be working with.
- [`snippets`](./snippets) - A set of snippets to add to Pieces during the demo
- [`prompts.md`](./prompts.md) - A set of prompts to use during the demo

## App setup

The bare bones Flutter app is a simple 'copilot' style app that interacts with Pieces OS running locally. It has one page setup already, and the second page is added through the demos that you will be running during this session.

To run this app, you will need:

- [Pieces](https://pieces.app) installed and running locally.
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) installed on your machine.
