# 10x Your Developer Productivity with AI-Enabled Tools

This folder contains all the resources for the 10x developer productivity talk and demo.

## Prerequisites

To run this demo, you will need:

- Pieces installed and running locally. You can download it from [pieces.app](https://pieces.app).
- Flutter installed on your machine. You can download it from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
- This repo cloned, with the `my_amazing_flutter_app` project loaded in an IDE and able to run.
- Start a chat with someone in a collaboration tool and ask them about a spinner to use in your app to show the copilot chat loading. Have them recommend spinkit.

## Train the trainer

There is a train the trainer video available to give a demonstration of this talk, with details on how to set it up.

## Hands on demos

The slides contain instructions for the hands on demos you can run.

### Recorded demos

There are video versions of each demo available with the pages marked as `disabled`:

```markdown
---
transition: fade
layout: center
disabled: true
---

<video controls width="640">
    <source src="/10x-developer-productivity/video/copilot-live-context.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

You can enable these by removing the `disabled: true` line. You can then use these videos in place of the live demos. When you navigate to the relevant slide, pressing next slide will play the video.

### Run the demos manually

You can find the app and snippets for the demos in the [`demo`](./demo) folder. This is referenced in the slides.
