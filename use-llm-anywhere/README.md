# Use an LLM anywhere with offline AI

This folder contains all the resources for the Use an LLM anywhere with offline AI talk and demo.

## Prerequisites

To run this demo, you will need:

- Pieces installed and running locally. You can download it from [pieces.app](https://pieces.app).

## Train the trainer

Coming soon

## Hands on demos

The slides contain instructions for the hands on demos you can run.

### Recorded demos

There are video versions of each demo available with the pages marked as `disabled`:

```markdown
---
transition: fade
layout: center
disabled: true
---

<video controls width="640">
    <source src="/10x-developer-productivity/video/copilot-live-context.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

You can enable these by removing the `disabled: true` line. You can then use these videos in place of the live demos. When you navigate to the relevant slide, pressing next slide will play the video.

### Run the demos manually

To run the demos manually, use the prompts given in the speaker notes, or ask the audience for some demo ideas.
